# Image and Video Inspection using Deep Learning

This project implements an image and video inspection system using a pretrained **ResNet-50** model.  
It performs real-time classification on video frames and displays predictions with confidence scores.

The system leverages pretrained ImageNet weights and can be extended with a company-specific trained dataset to improve domain-specific detection accuracy.
